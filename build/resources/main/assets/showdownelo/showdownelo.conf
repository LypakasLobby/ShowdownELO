# Sets the minimum amount of players that need to be online for the queue command to be useable
# This prevents people from waiting until themselves and a friend are the only two online to cheese the ELO system
# The queue system is random, so the more players that are online and in the queue the less likely two "bros" get queued up together
Minimum-Player-Amount=6
# Sets the number of players that need to be queued up before the random match pairing system puts players in battles
# I.e. once the list of queued players hits this number, the mod will attempt to put those players in battle with each other
Minimum-Queue-Size=6
# The amount of time, in seconds, before a player's attempt to queue up expires
Queue-Expiration=600
# The amount of time, in seconds, before the queue system starts to ignore "fair" pairings.
# From my experiences, Showdown tries to pair players with ELO ratings that are close together first.
# So, a player with an ELO of 1200 doesn't get paired with a player with an ELO of 1767.
# Showdown will attempt to pair the 1200 ELO player with someone about +-150 ELO points closer to him.
# But, the queue system will put these two players against each other after a certain amount of time has passed, so they aren't kept waiting forever.
# This value is how many seconds the mod will wait before doing that.
