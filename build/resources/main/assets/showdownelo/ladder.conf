# I made how the equations for ELO calculations work configurable.
# However, the default settings here should be exactly like how Pokemon Showdown does it.
# Like, I've actually sat down and manually ran calculations to figure this shit out - even with pen and paper.
# But, in the event you're a weirdo like me and like tinkering with complex mathematical equations, feel free to tweak this as you see fit.

ELO-Equation="%oldRate% + %scale% * (%actualOutcome% - %expectedOutcome%)"
Expected-Outcome-Equation="10^(%oldRatePlayerA%/400) / (10^(%oldRatePlayerA%/400) + 10^(%oldRatePlayerB%/400))"

# "oldRate" is the player's current ELO rating

# "scale" is a value that Showdown basically just made up
# Their scaling system:
# Elo is 1000, K = 80 for winner, 20 for loser
# Elo between 1001 and 1099, scales linearly between 80 and 50 for winner, between 20 and 50 for loser
# Elo between 1100 and 1299 = 50
# Elo between 1300 and 1599 = 40
# Elo 1600+ = 32
# This bit, the "Elo between 1001 and 1099, scales linearly between 80 and 50 for winner, between 20 and 50 for loser" is what I sat down and figured out
# From my calculations, for every 3 points on the ladder the scale value increases/decreases by 1 point

# %actualOutcome% is a static value. If the player WON, the value is 1. If the player LOST, the value is 0. If battle was a DRAW, the value is 0.5.

# %expectedOutcome% is where things get a little more complicated for puny math brain people, its a value that gets calculated by the following equation:
# expectedOutcome = 10^(oldRatePlayerA/400) / (10^(oldRatePlayerA/400) + 10^(oldRatePlayerB/400))

# So, for the sake of visual explanations, let's say I have an ELO of 1215 and I'm battling an oppenent with an ELO of 1234.

# If I win the battle (and therefore the opponent loses):
# 1215 + 50 * (1 - 0.47268402699) -> 1215 + 50 * 0.52731597301 -> 1215 + 26.3657986505 -> 1215 + 26 = 1241
# My ELO increases to 1241
# 1234 + 50 * (0 - 0.5273159730061233) -> 1234 + 50 * -0.5273159730061233 -> 1234 + -26.36579865030617 -> 1234 -26 = 1208
# My opponent's ELO decreases to 1208

# If I lose the battle (and therefore the opponent wins):
# 1215 + 50 * (0 - 0.47268402699) -> 1215 + 50 * -0.47268402699 -> 1215 + -23.6342013495 -> 1215 + -23 = 1192
# My ELO decreases to 1192
# 1234 + 50 * (1 - 0.5273159730061233) -> 1234 + 50 * 0.4726840269938767 -> 1234 + 23.63420134969384 -> 1234 + 24 = 1258
# My opponent's ELO increases to 1258

# For this bit: "Elo between 1001 and 1099, scales linearly between 80 and 50 for winner, between 20 and 50 for loser"
# To spare you a bit of more confusing math I don't quite fully understand myself, let me just show you:
# 1001 = 80
# 1002 = 80
# 1003 = 80
# 1004 = 79
# 1005 = 79
# 1006 = 79
# 1007 = 78
# 1008 = 78
# 1009 = 78
# 1010 = 77
# 1011 = 77
# 1012 = 77
# and then all the way down to
# 1088 = 53
# 1089 = 53
# 1090 = 53
# 1091 = 52
# 1092 = 52
# 1093 = 52
# 1094 = 51
# 1095 = 51
# 1096 = 51
# 1097 = 50
# 1098 = 50
# 1099 = 50
# And then reverse-engineer this for the other way around from 20 to 50
